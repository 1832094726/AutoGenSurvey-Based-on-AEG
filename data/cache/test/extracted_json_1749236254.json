    "detail": "Multi-pass sieve improves upon simple coreference resolution by applying tiers of deterministic coreference models from highest to lowest precision.",
    "problem_addressed": "Lower precision features overwhelming high precision ones and insufficient local information leading to incorrect decisions.",
    "evidence": "This approach can lead to incorrect decisions as lower precision features often overwhelm the smaller number of high precision ones. To overcome this problem, we propose a simple coreference architecture based on a sieve that applies tiers of deterministic coreference models one at a time from highest to lowest precision.",
