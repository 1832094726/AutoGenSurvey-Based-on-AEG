    "evidence": "Unlike them, it jointly learns how to parse and how to represent phrases as both discrete categories and continuous vectors as illustrated in Fig. 1. CVGs combine the advantages of standard probabilistic context free grammars(PCFG) with those of recursive neural networks(RNNs). (Socher et al., 2013) We introduce a new semantic parsing approach that learns to resolve such ontological mismatches. (Kwiatkowski et al., 2013)",
