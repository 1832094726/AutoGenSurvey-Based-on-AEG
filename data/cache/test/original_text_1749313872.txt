### Extracting Entities from Section: Reinforcement Learning

#### Section Content Summary:
This section discusses the use of reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize the solution accuracy of the math word problem solver. It explains the challenges of using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) and how RL can address these issues. The section also describes the policy learning approach using the REINFORCE algorithm and the mixed objective function that incorporates alignment loss.
