### Explanation:
1. **Yu2022_ImplicitQuantityRelations** extends **Hosseini2014_StateTransitionModel**: Yu et al. build upon Hosseini et al.'s work by adding Chinese phrase parsing and SVM classification to handle implicit quantity relations specifically in Chinese arithmetic word problems.

2. **Yu2022_ImplicitQuantityRelations** uses **ArithmeticWordProblems_2014**: Yu et al. evaluate their method using the Arithmetic Word Problems dataset, ensuring robustness in their experiments.

3. **Yu2022_ImplicitQuantityRelations** uses **Verb_Categorization_Accuracy** and **Sentence_Categorization_Accuracy**: These metrics are used to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method in handling verb and sentence categorization in arithmetic word problems.

4. **Yu2022_ImplicitQuantityRelations** uses **Stanford_CoreNLP**: Yu et al. leverage Stanford CoreNLP for efficient and accurate parsing of Chinese phrases, which is crucial for their method's success.
